## 💼 What I Do

I've worked across industries like **banking**, **retail**, **energy**, and **tech**, always focusing on solving real problems with code, data and curiosity.

- 🎯 **Pricing & Revenue Optimization**  
  I design smart pricing strategies to boost performance, margin, and customer value.

- 🧠 **Machine Learning & Forecasting**  
  I build models that predict, segment, recommend, and sometimes even surprise.

- ⚙️ **Big Data & Cloud Engineering**  
  Pipelines, ETLs and scalable solutions using tools like **Spark**, **Hive**, and **GCP**.

- 📈 **Data Visualization & Insights**  
  Dashboards that don’t just look pretty — they tell stories with tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, and **Looker**.
